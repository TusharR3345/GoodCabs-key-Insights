## Problem Statement:
Goodcabs, a cab service company, operates in 10 tier-2 cities in India and supports local drivers while providing excellent service to passengers. The company has set ambitious growth and passenger satisfaction targets for 2024. 

The Chief of Operations needs immediate insights into key performance metrics, including trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, and the balance between new and repeat passengers. 

However, due to the analytics manager's unavailability, the task has been assigned to me, to analyze these metrics and deliver actionable insights.
